<summary><strong>Inspiration for the Project</strong></summary>

I wanted to create something similar to futuristic patrol security robots that have a flashlight on top and they are moving around the room forever.

### Design Cycle

During this project activity i used this design cycle when i was designing my flashlight holder where my first prototype was too small where flashlight couldnt fit so i redesigned it and adjusted the size so the flashlight could fit.

### Code to Highlight
```java
  int left = myFinch.getLeftObstacleSensor();
  int right = myFinch.getRightObstacleSensor();

    if(left > 0 || right > 0){
```

- My motivation for building this project was that throught my whole life i watched many different futuristic movies and i remember seeing those kind of patrol security robots where they were patroling certain area and if they see you it would trigger and alarm system.
- With some adjustments this could be a really good security robot where many important places could have them to prevent robery.
- Throught this whole project i learned:
- - How to better use and code a README file
